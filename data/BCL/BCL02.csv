I've constantly discovered myself in management roles. I'm appropriate at assisting human beings discover what they are quality at. One time there has been this disaster at work. A cargo had long past awry and we have been approximately to be swamped with indignant customers. We had approximately 5 mins to prepare. Everyone became anxious and did not realize what to do to get ready. It became chaos. There wasn't a actual chief due to the fact we have been all on the equal level, so I simply took the reins. I positioned our quality communicators on the the front line, after which some people stayed in lower back to attempt to mitigate the problem.

1- The customer might have been paid to sabotage the company's product so they would ignore him
2-  Another member also said the customer might have consumed an outdated product and would tell the customer to bring a sample of the good so that the company authority can do checks on what has been causing disorderliness on him and his family.
3- Another member said they would refer the customer to the responsible authority for his complaints to be handled. Among others.

In all the group we found out that question demanding us to share how we would respond to our customers as marketers.

And it was really a good experience for developing my leadership skills. Thanks and best regards.,"I remember in my group (A), there was a course unit of Marketing and Cooperatives where we were given course work to work in a group to research about how we will be able to handle this customer who comes complaining about how bad effects and useless our product is impacting on him and his family member. And we had to discuss and discuss in length but at last, I gave everyone to go and make research on this and finally we came out with our findings as follows among the many;

1-One member found that the customer's family might be having some allergy since no customer had come for such complaints.
A 2-Another member found that the customer might have used an expired product.
3-On my side, first gave out how I will answer the customer that is will first apologise to the customer, thanked him for the feedback and got his contact to enable me to give him to feed after promising to share his complaint with the authority.

And in all our response, we found out that our group were the correct group in our response to the question since the quest required only how you will respond to the customer's queries.",34,Fellow Students.,A,B,C,C,B,A,A,B & C,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,85.727,1512.378,1519.377,34,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,7,3,9,10,3,4,10,4,9,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,7,3,6,7,6,6,1,1,1,2,6,5,56.067,826.116,830.989,10,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,,,,,,"",,,"",,,,,"",,"","",1,0,0.389249472080762,0.389249472080762,0,1,1,1,1,55620,927,15.45,Male,"","",Male,26,Christian: Protestant,Christian: Protestant,Married,Married,Bachelor’s degree,Bachelor's,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,29,0,1,26,1,1,1,1,7,7,1.33333333333333,7,1,7,1,7,1,3,5,6,7,4.85714285714286,6,2,6,1,1,7,1,2,6,3.57142857142857,3,9,-1,10,3,4,10,4,9,2,4.88888888888889,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,2,6,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,8,1,9,1,10,7.45454545454545,Christian: Protestant,6,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,47.5,7,7,6.5,7,7,7,4.85714285714286,3.57142857142857

As a head coach of Special Stars, I bring up a lot of young boys and some are presently playing improve football.
I was happy with them and also they are happy with me too.","So far so good. First I was an assistant coach in this football team (Special Stars FC) when the head coach desided to left but he asked me to bring another coach so that he can assist me and I accepted. But when this coach came he was doing well as the head coach but as time goes by, things began going abnormal between the players and the staffs 
But everything was enginered by the new coach, you here in Africa especially in my country (Sierra Leone) the support on football is very poor. Players go to the field everyday but they buy their boots and some football equipment for themselves so sometimes it will be very difficult to talk to some of the boys because we don't even pay them not even we the coaches, we were doing that for the Passion the love for the game. 
When things are started going bad, all the boys and the new head coach left and form a new team because they said they are not having courageous words from the management and we called them on a meeting to try to solve issues out but it was too last for us, they told us they won't come back again.
From that the management of Special Stars called  and asked me what would be our next move and I told them let try to find new boys and one of sinior asked me how could that possible then I said just leave that with me.
At last I succeeded and bring out new and young boys into the team and everyone got surprised at me, we began training and it went out successful.",30,Football team,Religious group,Football group,Old School group,Political party group,Ethnic group,Traditional group,Football group,Political group,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,7,1.067,1706.815,1707.668,172,6,6,7,6,4,7,7,5,6,6,7,7,6,5,7,6,6,6,7,5,,6,1,3,4,,,2,7,1,7,7,10,10,10,4,10,10,10,4,10,3,3,3,3,3,3,,,,,,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qual4236-2601OxfordChris,TRUE,6209,"",,,,,622a7f85-7b5e-5b30-f2eb-e0265bdb0c86,1,"",65+,1,0.492365963917331,0.937436866561092,1.42980283047842,0,7,7,7,7,6209,103.483333333333,1.72472222222222,Male,"","",Male,14,Muslim: Sunni,Muslim: Sunni,Divorced,Other,"Some high school, no diploma",Some high school,6,5,7,6,,6,1,3,6,6,7,5,4,,,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,7,31,0,0,14,7,7,6.33333333333333,6.33333333333333,6,6.33333333333333,,7,6,2,7,7,1,6,2,7,7,4.71428571428571,7,1,7,,,,,,,,10,10,-2,10,4,10,10,10,4,10,7.33333333333333,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,Muslim: Sunni,6,2,6,6,7,6,4,7,6,6,7,5,7,7,43,6.5,5.5,6,6,7,5,4.71428571428571,

Our tendency to distinguish between in-group and out-group members has moral implications.

People may harm those whom they perceive to be in an out-group in ways that they would not harm in-group members. For example, one study showed that when soccer fans viewed fans of their own team being harmed, they felt empathy. But when they viewed fans of a rival team being similarly harmed, they felt pleasure.

Likewise, people tend to make different moral judgments based on in-group and out-group distinctions. When someone in our in-group misbehaves, the natural reaction is often to dismiss the behavior as no big deal. But when someone in our out-group does the same thing, we will tend to judge the behavior much more harshly.

Indeed, when automatic in-group and out-group distinctions replace conscious and thoughtful reflection, we are more likely to harm one another and behave unethically.",I am really satisfied with the questions and I really enjoy answering and I’m pretty satisfied of the reward of answering questions and I hope to get more surveys in future,"While my job is leading technology development for DuPont Transportation & Industrial (T&I), a large part of what I do is leadership development.

Interest groups find the parties an important method of gaining access to those in public authority, and the parties need the support of groups to elect and maintain themselves in power. The loose party structure and the nature of the federal system foster a chain of continuous relationships between the two. Interest groups participate in both nonpartisan and partisan primaries and general elections through candidate endorsement, providing campaign funds, and general campaign activity. Interest groups are particularly interested in programs and seek to influence party platforms and may provide speech materials for candidates. There is some attempt on the part of both to infiltrate each other though rarely has an interest group been able to capture complete control of a party organization. The overlapping memberships help to educate the parties about the interests of the private groups and vice versa, and provide some cross-fertilization of ideas as well as manpower assistance. Political parties have a prime function of accommodating the demands of the private interests into the larger public interests.",My Pleasure,"In my role as the sales manager at Johnson & Williams, I was tasked with increasing the overall sales numbers from one quarter to the next. I used my experience as a salesperson to determine what methods work best for selling products and developed a presentation on three of the best ways to increase sales. When I gave this presentation, I encouraged the sales team members to share their insights and how they could apply the methods to specific deals that were currently in their pipelines. The following quarter, our sales numbers increased by 15%.”","Religious experiences can be characterized generally as experiences that seem to the person having them to be of some objective reality and to have some religious import. That reality can be an individual, a state of affairs, a fact, or even an absence, depending on the religious tradition the experience is a part of. A wide variety of kinds of experience fall under the general rubric of religious experience. The concept is vague, and the multiplicity of kinds of experiences that fall under it makes it difficult to capture in any general account. Part of that vagueness comes from the term ‘religion,’ which is difficult to define in any way that does not either rule out institutions that clearly are religions, or include terms that can only be understood in the light of a prior understanding of what religions are. Nevertheless, we can make some progress in elucidating the concept by distinguishing it from distinct but related concepts.

First, religious experience is to be distinguished from religious feelings, in the same way that experience in general is to be distinguished from feelings in general. A feeling of elation, for example, even if it occurs in a religious context, does not count in itself as a religious experience, even if the subject later comes to think that the feeling was caused by some objective reality of religious significance. An analogy with sense experience is helpful here. If a subject feels a general feeling of happiness",45,employees where I work,political group,religious group,ethnic group,political group,religious group,ethnic group,religious group,political group,6,5,5,6,6,5,4,5,6,5,4,4,48.861,124.252,146.284,9,5,5,6,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,6,6,5,3,4,4,6,5,4,3,4,6,4,4,4,6,5,5,6,4,7,2,5,9,5,4,5,4,9,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,3,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,50.388,50.388,68.594,1,5,5,4,4,3,6,6,5,6,5,,,,,"",,,"",,,,,"",,"","",0,0.792961461098759,0.668557923421521,1.46151938452028,1,5.33333333333333,6,6,5.66666666666667,3899,64.9833333333333,1.08305555555556,Male,"","",Male,61,Muslim: Shia,Muslim: Shia,Married,Married,Bachelor’s degree,Bachelor's,5,3,4,4,4,6,4,4,6,5,4,3,4,6,5,5,6,5,5,6,6,5,4,5,6,5,4,4,31,0,1,61,5.33333333333333,5.66666666666667,5,4.33333333333333,4,5,4.83333333333333,5,5,3,6,6,2,6,2,5,5,4,6,2,6,5,5,3,5,5,6,4.57142857142857,5,9,-1,5,4,5,4,9,4,4,4.33333333333333,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,5,4,4,3,5,3,5,4,4,3,6,4,6,3,8,5,Muslim: Shia,5,3,5,5,6,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,6,6,35.5,5.5,4.5,5,4.5,6,4,4,4.57142857142857

I used my experience as a salesperson to determine what methods work best for selling products and developed a presentation on three of the best ways to increase sales. When I gave this presentation, I encouraged the sales team members to share their insights and how they could apply the methods to specific deals that were currently in their pipelines. The following quarter, our sales numbers increased by 15%.”","Working together with other people for an assignment can be a challenging task in some cases but luckily, I worked well with my group members. The decisions we made were anonymous although we paced ourselves individually when it came to completing our separate parts of the essay. As a group I believe that we connected well on an interpersonal level as all four of us were able to make alterations to any problem together . Furthermore, we did not give each other a chance to get angry at one another as we knew that this would only cause conflict that would disrupt our flow as a group. There was an equal divide in the amount of work that we all did; our contributions were fair and no one was lacking behind. In addition, my group members were great at keeping each other informed if one of us were not able to attend a group meeting; emails were sent out informing us what we missed and ideas that were formulated. Everyone in my group worked according to deadlines and in synchronization with each other; we did not have to nag anyone to complete work or wait on a member to complete their task.
As a group, we were able to brainstorm and formulate themes together so everyone knew what the other member was writing about in order to avoid last minute confusion. Global expansion was the theme that I was most interested in and I expressed that to my group which they had no problem in allowing me to write about in the essay; our interests did not conflict as a group. I personally wanted to write about same day delivery as a theme, although I was made to realize by my group members that there were no articles strong enough to support the trend which made complete sense, thus the idea was dropped.

Currently there is a family from whom my family and I are renting a house. I must say that inasmuch as they believe differently, they have been good to me. I remember times I went to see them and pay my rent dues, they would pray for me and bless me and speak good words upon my life. They once said that I should only leave their house while going to my own house.these words have come to pass in my life. I have lived in this house for the past 5 years and in the last 3 Years I have bought 2 pieces of land and have constructed a house.
I believe their words have been good to me. So even if their faith is different from ours.","It would be good if instructions regarding number of options. I needed to understand what 1-7 meant. 

Regarding the pay, at least $2 would be good.","I have held various leadership roles in my life. However, I was a Women's Director and an Outreaches coordinator at a community rehabilitation center, Teen Challenge Uganda. I was in charge of recruiting distressed women into the program, guiding and counselling them, ensuring their health and safety together with their children, and I was also responsible for leading a team reaching out to Schools; sensitizing youth about the dangers of alcohol and substance abuse, and reaching out and supporting sex workers on the streets of Kampala.","In 2007, my family experienced a tragedy where we lost our home. My parent's home was demolished by a land grabber and in that season, we were very confused, had no where else to go and my parents were very helpless. I thought for a moment that I was not going to complete my studies because my father had lost his source of income too.

that is when I realized how great it was to have friends and family from church. My pastor and his wife offered a home for me and my siblings to stay and he also offered me a baby sitter's job so I could earn a living. Inasmuch as I didn't take that offer because my father wanted us to be in the same area, I felt encouraged that someone really cared.

Muslims believe Jesus (Isa) to be a messenger of God, not the son of God. so these beliefs makes Christian and Muslim differ alot they always end into an argument when they try to share beliefs and when they try to figure out which religion is right and which one isnt","The pay is fair, the questionnaire was clear",I was a president of the student's union at college I was the bridge between the school administration and the students,"My experience is that Christians are all over the map. Some are very sincere and others not. Some are mature and others not. Some are trying to follow the Bible and others just follow popularized versions of Christianity or even their own sinful desires. And I don’t quite know how to say this, but my belief is that not merely claiming to be a Christian doesn’t make you one. So there are all kinds. Like any other group, we probably shouldn’t throw all Christians into one category together. They vary quite a lot.

As a Christian myself, I acknowledge that many of us, myself included, have done and said many foolish and harmful things. We’ve also frequently had attitudes that are not right, including self-righteousness, feeling superior, being judgmental, thinking we’re right about everything and much more. I am sorry I have ever done any of these things, and even though I’m not really sure I can legitimately do this, I would also like to apologize for the many wrongs done by other Christians.

To me it is important to know that when Christians act in any of these wrong ways, they are not representing Jesus. Jesus is not the problem. We are, when we claim to follow him but don’t. No one is perfect, of course, except for Jesus. We need to cut Christians a break like anyone else. But we have sometimes been light years away from perfect and represented Jesus in ways that are terribly And that’s clearly wrong",200,Fellow college students,Christian,Ngoni tribe,MCP political party,Muslims,Tumbuka,DPP political party,Christian,Muslims,5,7,5,6,6,7,5,5,4,5,6,5,2.472,254.684,255.878,164,6,6,4,4,5,6,5,5,7,6,5,6,7,6,7,7,6,7,6,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,2,7,3,9,10,10,5,9,5,4,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,6,6,5,5,6,5,6,4,1,4,5,1,0.871,162.075,163.163,58,4,4,4,4,4,6,5,5,4,3,,,,,"",,,"",,,,,"",,"","",0,0.904534033733291,0.90033663737852,1.80487067111181,1,5.66666666666667,6,6,6.33333333333333,3787,63.1166666666667,1.05194444444444,Female,"","",Female,24,Christian: Other,Christian: Other,Married,Married,"High school graduate, diploma or the equivalent (for example: GED)",High school or equivalent,7,6,7,7,1,1,1,1,6,7,6,7,1,1,1,1,5,7,5,6,6,7,5,5,4,5,6,5,26,1,1,24,5.66666666666667,6.33333333333333,4.66666666666667,5.33333333333333,6.66666666666667,6.33333333333333,1,6,1,7,1,6,2,6,2,5,5,4,6,2,5,6,4,4,1,4,5,3.85714285714286,3,9,-1,10,10,5,9,5,4,4,5.44444444444445,1,7,1,7,1,7,3,5,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,8,3,7,1,10,7.18181818181818,Christian: Other,6,2,6,6,4,4,5,6,7,6,5,5,5,6,38.5,4,5.5,6.5,5,5.5,3,4,3.85714285714286

Going to church most Sundays is beneficial as the sermon teaches me how to be a better person and help society around me. I don't get caught up with too much religious dogma but I believe the ten commandments are a good guidline for my life and my relationships. A verse that sums up christianity is this quote from Jesus.

“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?”

“Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’”

“This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself'”

“On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”

What they show on the Tele or on Media is what the controversy-hungry people want to see.
Most Muslims are kind, generous and live normal lives

Christianity is a belief system that has augmented my life. Going to church most Sundays is beneficial as the sermon teaches me how to be a better person and help society around me. I don't get caught up with too much religious dogma but I believe the ten commandments are a good guidline for my life and my relationships. A verse that sums up christianity is this quote from Jesus.
“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?”
“Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’”
“This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself'”

“On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”
Matthew 22:36-40
That it's a load of bullshit.
Like most religions, it's used to manipulate and control people, and is dependent upon indoctrinating young children with religious dogma, before they become too old and are able to reason for themselves and see religion for the scam that it is.
One of my biggest regrets in life is that I spent so long blindly believing the bullshit that is Christianity.
I don't need the fear of hell or promise of heaven to know right from wrong and to be a good person.

I was able to design out a flyer to raise funds, which was distributed on social media. At the end of the two weeks campaign, we were able to raise an estimated amount of 50,000 ghs including foodstuffs which we distributed in three regions in the country to the poor and needy.

First of all, I gathered some volunteers that will help me in completing tasks and collecting unused or old clothes and in packing them. Keeping our goal in mind, we started making efforts to be successful. I gathered my two friends, sister and my mother for helping me. As, no work without a good helping team could be successful. We set our goals of delivering clothes to almost 100 needy people. Being a leader, I had to cooperate with team members and be friendly with others. I don’t only give orders to my team members to complete tasks or collect the clothes or pack 
them, in fact I worked with them together. Together we visited many houses to collect old unused clothes and also some toys for needy people. Moreover, we also give a responsibility of spreading this news through social media status which results in getting more clothes. We also spread awareness among people about helping others regularly. This helped us in getting more 
clothes. I also donate my unused clothes as well as some money to this savings which influenced others especially my team members. In the end, after a lot of efforts of 30 days, we got a successful result. Our drive became successful, and we delivered clothes to almost more than 100 people. This victory was only due to the cooperation of volunteers with leaders and a 
friendly environment in work.

There are also those who maintain  their  commitment  to  the  faith  as  the  final  and  best  revelation  in  which  a relationship with the divine can be achieved. To some of these the dominant motivation is obedience to the divine will but to others the emphasis of their practice is closeness or intimacy.  Categories of Religious Experience within the Muslim Communities in Britain In my book The Sufis of Britain, I have attempted to categorise the degree of mystical or spiritual experience that exists within Muslim communities in Britain by attempting to establish some criteria of motivation. Essentially I decided to look at the relationship between religion and ethnicity in order to provide some sort of ordering of motivation. After some deliberation it was decided to utilise four categories into which the varieties of experience could be placed. 1.  A loose allegiance to the traditional Muslim community defined as the Ahl-as Sunna wa Jamaat which represents the variety of Muslim ethnic communities present in Britain.  The adherents of this kind of allegiance to Sufism are not necessarily members of a tariqa (Sufi order) nor follow its self-purification practices. However, emotional bonds and loyalties to the Prophet are likely to be strong and Sufi shrines in the place of origin are likely to be visited. 2.  Those who are practising Muslims following both a tariqa and the shari’a (divine law) but still confined to a particular ethnic community.   RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE IN ISLAM
2In this category, membership of the tariqa will be confined to a homogeneous ethnic identity. Many members will belong out of a need for identity with a local movement or group arising from the specific place of origin in the country of birth. However, it is important to bear in mind that this kind of membership does not necessarily rule out mystical or religious experiences arising from deep",Thanks.

Thats why its now so hard to continue a social welbeing fund.,Thanks for giving me a chance to be free to talk the truth.,"It's a great honour if you have any opportunity to be a leader or having a role as a leader. I also have a leadership role in my life. As we live in Bangladesh,there are so many poor people around us who were lead a very hard life. When i was admitted in bachelor degree i was determine to do something for poor people of our country. There are some people around us who wants to provide helping hand for poor people,but they dont get opportunity to give that kind of help alone or having a chance of misuse of their money. I started to make some awareness and make a fund for help the poor people. It was so tough at that time because a lot of fraud people can be found around us who were always try to misuse of money. But i was so determined and honest. I started to collect money and after one month the amount was so big. Then i started to allocate all the money to the poor people and also them who were unable to bear educational cost of their children. And then I show people all the allocation details in a proper way. All the people started to belive me as a leader of our society who can change the society. After few months now i have  a poor fund and now i order junior students to do all the things that i had done before. They are so much interesting about it and they also collect new member for the fund. Now i have to maintain all the things as a leader. In that way i am now a way of change the society.

Participants first read an informed consent form and indicated their consent by checking a box on the form. Following this, they completed the SCS-Interdependence and other demographic questions (e.g., age, gender). The main study was conducted in a social psychology laboratory. Participants first read an informed consent form on a computer screen and indicated their consent by pressing a specified key. Then, participants were told that they would be shown faces that they should pay close attention to, as their memory for the faces would be subsequently tested. Each participant sat in front of a computer monitor as 24 pictures (12 White faces, 12 East Asian faces) were individually presented in the center of the monitor in a random order. Each photo was displayed for 10 s with an interstimulus interval of 2 s.

After a 5-min puzzle game, which served as a filler task, they completed the self-paced face recognition task. Participants viewed all of the 24 previously seen faces and 24 (12 White, 12 East Asian) new faces, presented individually and in a random order. Participants indicated whether they had seen each face previously by pressing one of two computer keys.",100,5,sports,culture,religious,boys club,political club,bazar club,3,3,5,6,3,4,6,6,7,4,4,3,4,5,113.844,113.844,130.762,1,5,6,3,4,5,6,5,6,3,7,5,5,6,6,5,3,3,7,5,5,,4,4,3,5,,,3,4,3,5,6,5,3,3,9,9,4,5,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,4,,,,,,4,3,5,3,4,5,5,4,5,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qual4236-2601OxfordChris,TRUE,789,3d7bee29-6efe-e3b2-5153-da502a1098cf,,,,,"",1,"",65+,0,1.28805702866407,1.20604537831105,2.49410240697512,1,4.66666666666667,5,5,5.33333333333333,789,13.15,0.219166666666667,Female,"","",Female,51,Muslim: Sunni,Muslim: Sunni,Divorced,Other,"High school graduate, diploma or the equivalent (for example: GED)",High school or equivalent,6,6,5,3,,4,4,3,3,7,5,5,5,,,3,5,6,3,4,6,6,7,4,4,3,4,5,66,1,0,51,4.66666666666667,5.33333333333333,5,4,5.66666666666667,5,,4,3,5,5,3,5,4,4,5,5,4.71428571428571,4,4,5,,,,,,,,5,3,5,3,9,9,4,5,3,3,5.11111111111111,1,7,1,7,3,5,3,5,3,5,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,Muslim: Sunni,5,3,6,6,3,4,5,6,3,7,5,6,5,5,35.5,3.5,5.5,5,5.5,5,1,4.71428571428571,

I felt unsure if my time and efforts would be worth committing myself to such a large club.
Before my freshman year, public speaking terrified me. Confronting my fears rather than avoiding them, I registered for HOSA’s “Researched Persuasive Writing and Speaking” competition. I felt foolish competing in an event that showcases my weakest skills. Months before the first round of competition, I began drafting my speech. I practiced for weeks, refining my text, recording my voice, and presenting to the bathroom mirror.
To me, leadership means the courage to overcome your fears, learn from failure, and inspire others to do the same. Serving as an Officer for my school’s HOSA Chapter, National Honor Society Chapter, and Band, I do everything I can to ensure the success of the organization I lead and its members. I will continue these positive habits as I transition to a leader on UT’s campus.",This is another effective example of how focusing on your most memorable activity or experience allows you to illustrate a story that indirectly demonstrates your leadership qualities.,"I have demonstrated leadership through my technical activities. My resume and extracurricular activities are well-rounded, but I focus on engineering-oriented activities. I enjoy solving technical challenges, and we always compete in groups. I often take the lead in helping direct the overall vision of our efforts. I enjoy coordinating group members to capitalize on everyone’s strengths and minimizing our overall weaknesses. My experience as a co-captain and captain for the TARC Rocketry Challenge Club suggests that I have a track record for accomplishing our goals. I also like taking complex topics and distilling down the most important parts to explain to new members crucial concepts in simple ways.","It was a great combination of highlighting teamwork and problem-solving abilities while suggesting that they have the interests and curiosities required to succeed in college.

“You can do it. I will help you!” Those words cemented a special bond with Jeeva, a visually impaired young man.
I felt a sense of purpose working with Jeeva. The joy in lending my eyes through reading, the challenge in describing objects and material things I took for granted, the satisfaction of transcribing his notes led me to a volunteering organization. I have since spent over 50 hours helping other visually challenged children and young adults like Jeeva. I also encouraged and facilitated my cousins to volunteer their time helping the visually challenged. Jeeva is now a teaching assistant at a school.",100,Members of TARC Rocketry Challenge Club,TARC Rocketry Challenge Club,Internship member,Friendzone,Teenagers till 18,College’s Statistics Club,Age Groups from 25-30,TARC Rocketry Challenge Club,College’s Statistics Club,5,6,7,5,7,5,3,4,4,3,4,6,13.215,131.657,134.346,15,7,5,5,4,5,4,7,4,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,3,3,3,5,1,5,10,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,1,3,3,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,0.702,124.616,125.153,5,5,5,3,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,,,,,"",,,"",,,,,"",,"","",0,1.37895436890245,1.08362466945083,2.46257903835328,1,6,6,6,5.66666666666667,1556,25.9333333333333,0.432222222222222,Female,"","",Female,65,Muslim: Sunni,Muslim: Sunni,Single,Unmarried,Bachelor’s degree,Bachelor's,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,6,7,5,7,5,3,4,4,3,4,6,23,1,0,65,6,5.66666666666667,3.66666666666667,4.33333333333333,4.33333333333333,3.66666666666667,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,4.28571428571429,4,3,5,3,3,5,1,5,10,2,4.22222222222222,3,5,2,6,2,6,3,5,3,5,3,5,1,7,3,5,3,6,5,5,3,8,5.72727272727273,Muslim: Sunni,7,1,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,7,4,4,5,35.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.5,4.5,4,4,4.28571428571429

Dk Shein aliwataka Watanzania kutathmini uzalendo wao ambao alisema umeshuka kwa kasi na hili sio jambo zuri kwa taifa.

Kwa maneno yaliozoeleka kusikika kutoka kwa wabunge na Wajumbe wa Baraza la Wawakilishi, ninamuunga mkono Dk Shein mia juu ya mia.

Hapana ubishi kwamba uzalendo ni mhimili muhimu wa kujenga taifa imara, ndio maana hata katika wimbo wetu wa taifa tunasema wazi wazi …Tanzania…Tanzania nakupenda kwa moyo wangu wote.

Lakini, tusisahau kuwa uzalendo unakuja kwa mamo mengi. Mwananchi hujiona ni mwana wa nchi aliyozaliwa na kuwa na uzalendo anapoona kwa vitendo anathaminiwa, kuheshimiwa na kuenziwa kama mzalendo.

Inapotokea mtu anaona uzalendo wake umepuuzwa na hathaminiwi kama raia huona hana sababu ya kuonyesha uzalendo kwa sababu yeye hahesabiwi kama mzalendo na kwa kuwa ni hivyo kwa ini ajipakazie sifa asiyostahiki?

Nimesema hivi kwa sababu mbalimbali. Mngoni mwao ni ile ambayo nimeipigia kelele mara nyingi juu ya baadhi (kama sio wengi) ya watu wa Zanzibar kuona au kuhisi uzalendo wao hauthaminiwi na wananyimwa haki za kiraia.

Kwa mfano, mpaka leo wapo mamia ya watu wamenyimwa haki ya kiraia ya kuwa na kadi ya utambulisho wa kuwa ni Wazanzibari licha ya wao na wazazi wao kuzaliwa katika visiwa vya Unguja na Pemba.

Ukichunguza utaona hii inatokana zaidi na mambo ya kisiasa. Kutokana na hali hii wanakosa haki yao ya kushiriki katika uchaguzi na hata kupata tabu, kukosa mambo mengi kama hati ya usafiri, leseni ya biashara na mambo mengine.

Hivyo, kweli mtu anayetendewa haya atakuelewa unapomtaka aonyeshe uzalendo wakati huo uzalendo wake hauthaminiwi?

Nalizungumzia hili sio kwa utani na ninaamini kama patafanyika mikutano kila wilaya ya kuwataka wajumuike watu walionyimwa kadi za utambulisho wa Mzanzibari na ya kupiga kura basi kila ukumbi utafurika watu.

Watu hawa wapo tu Visiwani, hawana mbele wala nyuma.

In my neighborhood, we had women's union (informal) of assisting one another, morally and in material terms, during celebrations and in difficult times","Our group is composed of members over 60 years old. We are struggling very hard to conserve the cleanliness of our neighborhood and have now started an anti noise pollution campaign. There is a bureaucratic procedure to be followed before the matter is presented to the national environmental offices, which involves first presenting the xaese to the local government wards. The noise generators (alcohol bars and pubs) are financially well off and easily find their ways to block us at this level. It is rather challenging. However, the local government is assisting by making efforts to keep the environment clean. Another challenge comes from the noise generated by the increase of spiritual rebirth churches.

Entering into the university I had to met with old friends and make new ones and with a new friend (now late) I made, was a social individual from a rich family and was assisting me with so many things. He was desperate and so desire to join a social club and with me as a best friend he had to convinced me that we will both join the club together. To cut it short, we were doing everything in common and had to purchased the forms for both of us for admitting us to the club and we've also gone ahead and filled our forms. But it was one day that the club had a friendly match with a sister club and I was unable to attend the match because I was sick, so during the evening hours they decided to go clubbing and to the beach. They called me to go with them but I had to tell them that I'm seriously ill and can't take it with them. It was a very tragic moment as on their way home from clubbing, they involved in an accident and they all died. Friends started calling me thinking that I was with them as they said you were always together but I told them that no I'm still alive and I'm sick as that's what prevented me from joining them. So since then through out my stay in the university I decided not to be part of any social club.
","",The most important leadership role I've held is youth president in my church. And as a youth president you need to be committed in doing the work of God and your life must reflect a Christ like life because others see you as an example. You must also have the courage to face every problems from your fellow youths colleagues. I had to use wisdom to bring in social life styles of youths into the church in a godly form so they will felt that they are all part of happenings all over the world.,"I can recall when we had a youth thanksgiving service, during our rehearsed a lot of suggestions came up on how the program will be on some where the team song, welcome song and to do a short drama concert. All of these were accepted by the leadership of the youth group and the pastor in charge of youths. Shortly after a new converted youths suggested that we do a group dance like how musical clips are been done and also described the costume which is purely African and such costume it will not cover every part of your skin. So some people that were so holy went against the suggestions but o had to talk with the pastor and later the entire youth membership not to be so spiritual as we will try to undertake the project in a godly way. So we later decides on the costume and the song which we rehearse and it was successful. I tried to handle the matter wisely because at the look of things the new convert who had suggested the group dancing as part of the program would have left the church if we would have just refused his suggestion and told him that it's not of God by condemning the dancing concert.

I was having a conversation online with a group of over 300 students, it was an online CAS project with many international schools participating, We were to sing heal the world by Michael Jackson, we were then split into small groups of 5 on our 2nd meeting to get familiar with several people of different nationalities. We ended having a conversation about LGBTQ and I voiced opinions and facts on why I thought it doesn't seem practical and moral to assign a little boy who hasn't even turned 10 a gender other than what he was born with. In context a mother gave a 8 year old boy the gender of non-binary, I mean he hasn't even experienced life, let him make such a big decision on his own, making him non-binary doesn't give him both choices but alienates him from ever having a strong ingroup, for example he can't be a boy scout because he isn't a boy and can't join girl groups like cheerleading because he isn't one, it may give the illusion of freedom of choice but truly it's the opposite.
After voicing out my opinion she just threw a tantrum and started calling me homophobic without critically understanding my opinion. I have also watched several videos of similar encounters. After that I grew a passion for debating against the LGBTQ movement.",It took a lot more than 20 minutes.,"Managed my father's business when he was away, from writing invoices to accounting, recording stocks to helping deliver to malls and instructing employees.","We were having a tournament in teams of 6, playing rounds of 5 different games.

However, this was very challenging considering that I had only one cow producing milk that was entirely consumed by family and i had nothing surplus to sell. This affected me because even money to pay the herds' man had to come from my pocket which eventually became very costly in the short and long term.  Consequently, I got the thought, to get a better cow with much more milk that I could sell the surplus, and surely, this worked and gave me the opportunity to save the money to buy more cows that transitioned me into a fully fledged commercial diary farmer as a major household income source.",The pay wasn't corresponding with the amount of work in the questionnaire.

In a record time of about 2 years, I had risen to the position of Station Manager; a position that brought out my specific interest in human resources and management.
As Station Manager, I grew my leadership skills and overtimes, I was able to inspire and influence the growth of several juniors within the company in preparation to take up bigger challenges in the company and beyond. As such, several competent staff were identified to take up more advanced roles. This later included the current Manager whom I personally nurtured for the uphill task, when I resigned to start my own business.
Reflecting on my leadership skills and competencies, I feel a sense of self gratitude and fullfilment.","Recently, I developed breathing complications and collapsed.

I am saying this from experience. Fasting draws you closer to God and it embroiders your knowledge on the word of God, it keeps you busy from the worldly things. and what I have come to realize is that when you put His words back to him (what He promised in the Bible)during payers, He is going to do it for you. There is nothing too hard for him just pray without ceasing in faith. I remember some years ago when I was sacked from school due to debt and my parents were also going through financial difficulties. It was just left with some few days for us to write exams, I didn't know what to do and my parents were worried too, they both told me that they would go and seek for help from their friends but nothing good came out from that.
Crazy options were running through my mind but I ignored them all and said to myself though my parents are not Christians but that won't stop me from fasting, so I decided to fast the next day. I fasted and prayed for 3 days but didn't see any result, but didn't stop the fasting .my mom told me that she would go with me to the school to plead on my behalf, so the next day I went to church still hoping to hear some good news back home after church, I wasnt myself, the thought of the exams filled my eyes with tears. So after church a certain woman approached me and asked me what was my worry, I told her everything, and then she said """" this is not a problem at all wipe your tears and take me to your parents """".These were the exact words she said to me.

Ethnic love and norms. Our ethnic values greatly guide me through my life journey as I have to reflect on what I have done as a """"muganda"""" and whether it is done by people from our culture. This has helped me to always produce good work. This is the civilisation attached to our ethnic group which existed even before colonialism. Iam very proud of my ethnic group and love it the more because it assimilates other groups into it. This has helped me to make friends from other groups who can even speak the same local language as me.

Although its roots go back further, scholars typically date the creation of Islam to the 7th century, making it the youngest of the major world religions. Islam started in Mecca, in modern-day Saudi Arabia, during the time of the prophet Muhammad’s life. Today, the faith is spreading rapidly throughout the world.",Thanks,Team Leader for enforcement Team,"The argument maintains that special episodes, such as seeing visions of Christ or Mary or hearing the voice of God, as well as the more pervasive experience of “living in God’s presence” or of “absolute dependence upon a higher power,” constitute evidence of God as their source. Although such experiences may be accepted as having occurred, their cause, as critics have noted, might be purely natural. To establish that the experiences are real, as experiences, is not to establish that they are caused by an infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, divine being. As Thomas Hobbes succinctly put it, when someone says that God has spoken to him in a dream, this “is no more than to say he dreamed that God spake to him” (Leviathan, Pt. III, ch. 32).

The analogous argument, from miracles to God as their cause, is more complex and involves two sets of problems. The argument may assert that the children of Israel were miraculously rescued from Egypt or Jesus was miraculously raised from the dead and therefore that God must exist as the agent of these miracles. The first problem concerns the reports. Whereas in the case of private religious experiences the skeptic (to whom the argument is addressed) may well be willing to grant that such experiences occurred, in the case of public miracles the skeptic will require adequate evidence for the described event; and this is not forthcoming for the classic miracle stories referring to alleged extraordinary events of many centuries ago. There are, however, well-evidenced contemporary and recent accounts of “miraculous” healings and other remarkable happenings. On the assumption that some of these, and also some of the classic miracle stories, are historically accurate, the second problem arises. How can it be established that these events were caused by divine intervention rather than by the operation of natural phenomena?

I just wanted to point that out .","As the eldest daughter, I am the deputy parent of my siblings I take charge when my parents aren't home and I am responsible for my siblings actions and well being. As the eldest my actions serve as a lesson or a goal for my siblings, so of I do something bad they will feel that they have a right to do it too since I did it . My role as a deputy parent also involves emotional support for my siblings and as a peace maker between my parents and my siblings.","I can't remember the exact day or year this happened, I do remember how my weeb friends helped me realize am not alone and that it's okay to be a weeb even when some of them were bullied for it for a long time and still stuck to their interest.

So therefore, we seek their opinion and accept them as humans and gives them the necessary counselling and advice since the same bible that talk against the LGBT say that shall not kill and love your neighbours as your so and for that matter why should we kill them. Hence with my opinion the chiefs and some Traditional leaders accepted and free this LGBT group and pardon them for that.","Thank you for the survey

Other than that enjoyed taking part of this survey . Incredible questions.
Thanks for having me .","About a year ago, I worked for an international asset finance company. I was their first employee when they moved to my country. After probation , myself & my colleagues realized we were not being fairly compensated for our time & resources.
I started holding weekly welfare meetings with my colleagues, where I let them air out their grievances and suggestions on ways forward.
During this time I also tried to do research on how we could get a proper pay raise after probation especially with the extensive working hours.
With all the resources I gathered , I helped bring these concerns to management.
Even though our requests were not received as we had expected and rarely any changes were made resulting in me resigning at the end of the year , however the working hours we cut down by an hour daily which was worth something. 
It wasn’t a huge change but it pushed for better welfare for those around me and also paved the way for people speaking up when their welfare were not being taking seriously.
And that was an important leadership role.","We went to a pub quiz as spectators. I have social anxiety, so I didn’t want or participate on the first day , I wanted us to go see the vibe then try out the following week.
I recall we came in late & seating accommodations were scarce but we managed to score some seats .
A few moments later , a group of guys headed to our table & asked us to leave that they had been there an hour ago but left since it wasn’t full yet.
I got up instantly, because I hated scenes in public spaces , one of my housemates (let’s call him V) held my hand and asked me to sit down.
Even though the other group was making a scene , he stood his ground and not once did he lose his temper or engage with exchanging angry words.
He calmly listened to them then explained why we weren’t going to leave the table .
In that moment, I was upset because I felt uncomfortable especially with all the attention the uproar drew to us , but later that night , I’m glad V stood up for us and I learnt from him that I should stand my ground regardless of how uncomfortable it may seem , and also proper conflict resolution.
